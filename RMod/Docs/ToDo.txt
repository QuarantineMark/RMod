- Implement working arena mode
- DM+, TDM+, AR+, etc
	- Maybe this should be made into a mutator or a setting that can just be turned on / off (like hardcore mode)
- Display which player you're spectating
- Hide spectator chat from players, unless spec is admin maybe?
- Alt fire to go backwars through players?
- Maybe a new mini scoreboard option?
- Fix player pitch after falling in water
- Get arena mode set up

Wishlist:
- Dual wielding capability
	- Requires Ragnar to be rigged (need to do this for RuneArena anyways)
	- Requires new animation sets
	- Requires inventory code alterations

- Idle animations using the cinematic anims

BUGS:
- Invisible inventory traveling between maps
- Player names disappear from sent messages when they leave the server
- Player messages are not aligned correctly in-game
- Slade received many of the following errors during gameplay:
	ScriptWarning: R_RunePlayerHUD DM-ColbyFinish8.R-RunePlayerHUD0 (Function RMod.R_RunePlayerHUD.DrawMessages:04FA) Accessed None
- Players occasionally freeze as a result of client adjust position changes
- SessionKey does not function as intended, should replace with IP ties to player rep infos
- Player arms are not hidden when severed
- Spectator view pitch does not show correctly when view target is in climb state
- Phantom spectator (this is indeed the RuneAdminSpectator spawned by WebAdmin. Should be able to fix by checking bIsPlayer)

TODO:
- MakeTeam clanwar feature did not work great, since players teams reset every time map changes
- Add player names to spectator mode
- Mini scoreboard for spec mode
- Segregate spectator chat
- Add kill message feed
- Add in-game command to update the MOTD
- Change name of game types to original, like RMod.RuneMultiPlayer, so they show up in server list
- Add player names and time logs to all console messages
- Update end game camera to orbit around players and switch between them
